## How to Run

streamlit run app.py




Lessons learned:

Database Management: One of the key lessons learned was how to manage a SQLite database within a Python application. Understanding how to create tables, insert, retrieve, update, and delete data was crucial for building a functional task management app.

Pydantic for Form Handling: Learning to use Pydantic for form handling in Streamlit was valuable. It provided a convenient way to define data models for tasks and validate user input. This made it easier to create and manage tasks.



Questions/Future improvements:

Search and Filtering: One potential improvement is to implement a search bar and filter dropdowns for categorical fields, as mentioned in the requirements. This would enhance the user experience by allowing users to find specific tasks more easily.

User Authentication: Adding user authentication and user-specific task lists could be a valuable feature for a multi-user environment. It would require implementing user accounts and ensuring data privacy.

Task Deletion: Implementing the bonus feature for task deletion could be a useful addition. Currently, there's no functionality to delete tasks, and adding this feature would make the app more complete.

User Feedback: Collecting user feedback and making iterative improvements based on user suggestions would be beneficial. User testing can reveal usability issues and help prioritize feature enhancements.
